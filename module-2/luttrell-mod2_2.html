        <h2>All About The Luttrells</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            My name is Jason Luttrell. My last name has noble origins that 
            traces its lineage from the Norman kingdoms of norther France, 
            through the battle of Hastings in the eleventh-century. As part of 
            the conquering Norman invasion my ancestors became British nobility 
            and maintained their noble status for hundreds of years. Two 
            brothers in the beginning of the eighteenth-century fled England 
            to escape scandal and &rsquo; prison to the shores of America. 
            <span class="sentence">These two brothers are the progenitors of all 
            the Luttrells in the United States. </span></p>

        <p>When the two fallen nobles arrived in the United States, they 
            traveled to present day North Carolina and bought a truly massive 
            swath of land that included most of western North Carolina, part 
            of Tennessee and part of Kentucky. They were incredibly wealthy 
            again with such a massive swath of land, until the revolutionary 
            war. When the colonial army won independence, the confederated 
            states confiscated the land of many land owners to redistribute it 
            to the soldiers who fought in the war.</p>

        <p>While the two brothers still retained a very large estate, 
            measurable in square miles, they had lost most of what they had. 
            But they still did quite well, and their ancestors still occupy 
            North Carolina and Tennessee today. There was also a rather large 
            group of Luttrells that traveled to Southern Illinois in search of 
            land. That group is where I am descended from.</p>
            
        <p>The Luttrells of my line (the Illinois Luttrells) are marked by a 
            profound devotion to Christ, an extremely strong work ethic, and a 
            connection to nature. Of course there are some exceptions, but not 
            many. In fact, one of my Aunts was a miracle worker. She was known 
            to be able to stop the bleeding of any wound, simply by praying. 
            The effect of her prayers was immediate, and even the town doctor 
            would send word to Aunt Blackie when someone was injured to stop 
            the bleeding. It worked on livestock and people.</p>
